        This project was part of a collaborative effort within the Gendered Landscape initiative, focusing on reimagining how urban spaces can be made safer and more inclusive. Set in Umeå, Sweden, the design centered around improving the user experience of nighttime visitors walking to Nydalasjön to view the Northern Lights. </p>
        <p class="allprojects-description">The project applied participatory and ethnographic design methods to co-design interventions that increase social presence, perceived safety, and enjoyment. The final concept, which was named “GoFigure,” proposed a three part system. The first part focuses on a system of color-coded, sensor-activated light paths that helped guide, brighten up, and make the journey to Nydalasjön more interactive.
          The second part introduces interactive public screens that would increase the perceived safety and connect people around the city. The final part, was a mobile application that's accessible through QR codes on the light poles.
        The workshops and field studies conducted showed that the concept has promise, as well as provided suggestions for what it could look like if implemented.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h2>Problem & Context</h2>
      <p>While Nydalasjön is a popular location for observing the Northern Lights, its surrounding dark forested paths can deter visitors due to safety concerns, this is especially true for women. The issue was not just lighting but also that the location is quite isolated from the rest of the city.
         The project was a part of the Gendered Landscape initiative in Umeå, aiming to redesign public spaces with a gender-inclusive perspective. The concept of "GoFigure" tries to increase the perceived safety, visibility, awareness, and interaction of the location.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="approach">
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>The design process began with brainstorming sessions grounded in research on perceived safety in urban environments. Initial insights were gathered through literature reviews and environmental observations around the lake's pathways, particularly those least populated or poorly lit.
      Two workshops were conducted in this project. The first focused on ethnographic observation and design ideation within in team, and the second involved women from Umeå as active participants where our concept was presented. These workshops generated ideas in relation to the concept as well as gave us valuable insights into what the experience of walking in the dark was like for women.
      Based on these workshohps, the design ended up focusing on non-intrusive smart urban objects that would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase visibility and the sense of human presence.</li>
        <li>Enable device-free navigation.</li>
        <li>Offer ways to socially connect with others using the space.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="design-solution">
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <p>The final design concept, "GoFigure", introduced three core parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive Light Pathways - Motion-sensor light poles that illuminate the path ahead and behind the user, color-coded based on where the user began walking from (e.g. Vasaplan, Ålidhem, Ersboda) to offer guidance without the need of a map or a phone.</li>
        <li>Public Interactive Screens - Large digital interactive screens placed at different parts throughout the city at the end of the lit pathways. These would allow for anonymous social interactions across the city, in the form of stick figures mimicing peoples actions live. The idea is to help the different parts of the city feel connected, less isolated, and in turn increase the feeling of perceived safety and community presence.</li>
        <li>Mobile App - Despite the focus on device free guidance, an optional app is accessible through scanning the QR codes on the light poles. The app is meant to introduce the concept to new visitors, as well as provide access to digital maps if needed. </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="outcomes">
      <h2>Impacts & Insights</h2>
      <p>The concept of "GoFigure" challenged the typical approach to urban safety by shifting from surveillance-based solutions, to explore a more grounded and interactive solution. The workshops and field studies revealed five key user needs that helped shape the final concept:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People feel safer when they can see and sense others, even indirectly. The motion-activated lights and interactive screens aims to help with this.</li>
        <li>Making the walk feel more engaging and interactive makes the walk more enjoyable. For example with the help of the motion-activated color-coded lights and the interactive screen.</li>
        <li>Being able to navigate without a need for applications. This makes the experience more inclusive, and even supports situational awareness for users.</li>
        <li>To remember that safety is an experience, not just a metric. The concept emphasized how people feel, not just how safe a place is on paper</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overall, the concept was well received. Future directions could be to expand the concept to other areas in the city, addressing accessibility concerns (e.g tactile paths, braille signage, audio cues), and trying to reduce any potential light pollution in the forest.</p>
